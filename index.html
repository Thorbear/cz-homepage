        <b>Firefox 0.9 support added</b>.
        With Firefox 0.9 being released in just a few days, we've now fixed 
        the majority of issues with ChatZilla running on current versions of
        the Mozilla Firefox browser. Please get the 
        <a href="#revisions">latest revision</a> to try it out.

        <b>Mozilla blocks XPInstall from "untrusted" hosts</b>.
        <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240552">Bug 
        240552</a> blocks XPInstall from "untrusted" hosts, which means you
        can no longer install ChatZilla directly from this website with 
        Mozilla 1.7 and newer. Instead, you need to download the XPI files 
        and open them in Mozilla on your computer.

        <b>ChatZilla now supports DCC File transfers</b>.
        Yes, it's finally here, but don't expect it to be perfect just yet - 
        it's still very much a work-in-progress feature. Download the 
        <a href="#revisions">latest revision</a> if you want to try it out.

        <b>ChatZilla's preference window now works in Mozilla Firefox</b>.
        It took some time, but it's finally working. Anyone who uses ChatZilla
        in Mozilla Firefox should check out version <b>0.9.54c</b> or later, 
        and we'd love to hear suggestions for making it better. <i>Note: all
        versions since <b>0.9.63</b> have this feature as standard, and work 
        in the Mozilla Suite and Mozilla Firefox.</i>
