    <h2>Welcome</h2>

      ChatZilla is a cross platform messaging client that combines 
      Internet Relay Chat (IRC) with existing web standards like JavaScript,
      HTML, and CSS.  If you don't know any of this stuff don't worry, you
      don't have to.  ChatZilla is easy to use.  For more information, please
      read the <a href="faq/chatzilla-faq.html">FAQ</a>.

    <h2>News</h2>

    <div class="newsitem">
      <b>January 11, 2006</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A lot has happened recently, and <b>ChatZilla 0.9.69.2</b> is now out.
        The big issues currently are
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321195">motifs
        not displaying properly</a> and the
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=318419">timer
        problem</a> - luckly we've managed to get the first one fixed (for
        Firefox 1.5.0.1), and are making good headway with the second one.
        These are both Firefox (Gecko) bugs, but they only affect us seriously,
        which is why we get to do all the hard work!
      <li>
        The other news is that starting with ChatZilla 0.9.69.2, 1% of all new
        users will be asked to enabled a "startup ping", which will send the
        client's version to one of our developer's servers each time it starts.
        Nothing except the client version, and the name and version of the host
        app (Firefox, Mozilla, XULRunner) is sent - certainly nothing that
        could identify the user - and there is the option to not send the ping.
        This data should help us to idenify what people are doing with
        ChatZilla - do they run it on older versions of Mozilla, for example,
        and how long they take to upgrade to the newest release. We should
        also be able to estimate the number of active users, which is much
        more useful that the simple "download count" we currently have.

      <b>October 30, 2004</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>ChatZilla 0.9.66</b> includes a new version of the ChatZilla
        plugin API - you can find more details in the 
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262037">bug 
        report</a>.
      <li>
        <b>ChatZilla 0.9.66a</b> features a new channel list dialog, 
        accessible from File > Join Channel, Ctrl-J, or <tt>/join</tt>. The
        dialog lets you search for channels containing certain text in their
        name or topic, as well as minimum and maximum user filters. Get the
        <a href="#revisions">latest version</a> to try it out.

    <h2>Download</h2>
      Click on one of the the "install" links below to install or upgrade
      ChatZilla.  Please note:
    <ul>
      <li>
        ChatZilla does not work on "native" Mozilla embeddings such as
        <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon</a> and
        <a href="http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/">K-Meleon</a>.  Same goes for
        <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22blue+screen+of+death%22&btnG=Google+Search">Internet Explorer</a>.
      <li>
        Depending on how you installed Mozilla, you may need to log in as
        <tt>root</tt> or <tt>Administrator</tt>.      
      <li>
        ChatZilla is also available in 
        <a href="http://www.softcatala.org/projectes/mozilla/#chatzilla">Catalan</a>,
