                        We don't ask much, really. We just want to pitch in for the bandwidth on hacksrus.com, send out schwag to contributors in various parts of the world, and maybe get a beer or two. Donations are accepted via PayPal, click on the donate button below and enter your dollar amount. It's the fastest and easiest way to contribute, and requires no special skill on your part :)

                        If you follow the image below to Amazon.com, anything you buy during that session will generate some cash for ChatZilla. So go buy yourself a new HDTV and tell your wife you did it for the good of open source software.

They've been providing web space for ChatZilla since the beginning (more than four years now), and besides that, he's a really smart guy.

                    Everyone loves documentation. You can <a href="faq/#add-question">submit new questions</a> for the FAQ, write user documentation, developer documentation, or whatever else you can think of. If you're going to start a large undertaking, you may want to announce it on the <a href="faq/#newsgroup">newsgroup</a>.

Some of these bugs have been fixed but never marked as such, some no longer apply, and some should be getting more attention then they do. Please, familiarize yourself with the entire bug list before trying to help out here. If you're not sure about something, ask in <a href="faq/#irc">#chatzilla</a> first.

                    Once you're familiar with the bug list, you might want to try your hand at fixing some of them. You'll need to know a bit of JavaScript first, of course. For small fixes you can probably work from the chatzilla.jar file installed in your browser. For anything larger than a few lines though, you'll want to check out the code directly. The FAQ explains <a href="faq/#source">where to find and how to get the source code</a>. We can help you out in <a href="faq/#irc">#chatzilla</a> when questions come up.
