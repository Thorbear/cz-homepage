  How do I install ChatZilla?
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla is currently distributed with Mozilla.
  Download the
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">latest Mozilla release</a>,
  and select <b>Full</b> or <b>Custom</b> when installing.
  <p/>
  If you're running Netscape 7.x, or already have Mozilla installed and simply
  want to add or upgrade ChatZilla, visit the
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/">ChatZilla Development Page</a>.
  <p/>
  <p>
  On all platforms, you will need to restart your browser after installing.
  On all versions of Windows, you will need to exit the quick launch icon on
  your taskbar as well, and on <b>some</b> versions of Windows, you may need to
  restart the operating system.

  How do I start ChatZilla?
</question>

<answer>
  <ol>
    <li>You can start ChatZilla from the
       <b><u>W</u>indow-&gt;IRC Chat</b> menu.
    </li>
    <li>You can also start the browser with the <tt>-chat</tt> command line

    </li>
    <li>You can type an <tt>irc</tt> in the URL bar. Type just <tt>irc:</tt>
      to launch ChatZilla and connect to default channels.  Currently, this
      is the recommended way to launch ChatZilla from within Mozilla Firebird or
      Phoenix.  Note that you can bookmark this URL, and file it wherever it
      to make sense to you.

<entry id="connect">
<question>
  How do I connect to a server?
</question>

<answer>
  Type <tt>/server irc.servername.com</tt>.  You may also pass a port and
  server password to the /server command.  See <tt>/help server</tt> for
  more information.
  <p/>
  ChatZilla allows you to be connected to multiple servers, so unlike some
  other clients, <tt>/server</tt> will not disconnect you from your current
  server.  You can manually do that with the <tt>/disconnect</tt> command.
  <p/>
  ChatZilla comes preset with a few popular irc networks.  Use the
  <tt>/networks</tt> command to list the available networks.  You may click
  on a network name or use the <tt>/attach</tt> command to connect to a network
  by name.
  <p/>
  <a name="attach"></a>
  The <tt>/attach</tt> command accepts an
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/irc-urls.html">irc: URL</a>
  as a parameter.  You may omit the <tt>irc://</tt> prefix, however.  This
  can be used to connect to a network and channel with a single command,
  such as <tt>/attach moznet/chatzilla</tt>, or
  <tt>/attach moznet/killer,isnick</tt>.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="join">
<question>
  How do I join a channel?
</question>

<answer>
  Once you have connected to a server, you can join a channel by typing
  <tt>/join</tt>, follwed by the channel name.  For example, if you want to
  join <tt>#worldchat</tt> on <tt>undernet</tt>, you would first connect
  to undernet with the <a href="#server">server</a> or
  <a href="#attach">attach</a> command, then type <tt>/join #worldchat</tt>.
  <p/>
  If you omit the channel prefix, ChatZilla will prepend a "#" automaticaly.
  <p/>
  The command <tt>/j</tt> comes predefined as an alias for <tt>/join</tt>.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="list">
<question>
  How can I list the available channels on a server?
</question>

<answer>
  The <code>/list</code> command can be used to fetch a list of all channels on
  the current network.  On large networks, however, this may take a very long
  time.  On some networks, you'll be kicked off with a message like ``Excess
  Flood'' for doing this.  Adding to the confusion, some networks recognize
  extended <code>/list</code> options for filtering based on number of
  users in a channel, etc.
  <p/>
  ChatZilla also offers an <code>/rlist</code> command, which can be used to
  filter the result list based on the channel name, regardless of the
  server software.  Type <code>/help rlist</code> for more information.

<entry id="hide-ip">
<question>
  How can I hide my IP address from other users?
</question>

<answer>
  You can't.  The way IRC works, your IP address is distributed to every
  user you communicate with.  Depending on where you hang out, and who your
  enemies are, this may or may not be a problem.  In practice, it's not a
  problem for most normal users.

<question>
  How do use I DCC to transfer files with ChatZilla?

<answer>
  ChatZilla does not support DCC.  This is a limitation of

<entry id="charset">
<question>
  How do I select a character set?
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla allows you to select character sets at multiple levels.  The default
  character set used by ChatZilla is UTF-8, and it is recommended that you leave
  this setting wherever possible.  Mixed character sets can not work together
  seamlessly on the same irc network, although they will for the most part work
  in ChatZilla.  By standardizing on UTF-8, we avoid a number of unsolvable
  problems, such as how to know what encoding has been used for particular 
  channel names without proir knowledge.

  <p/>
  The table below lists the charset commands available in ChatZilla.
  Each of these commands takes a case-insensitive character set name as a
  parameter.  If a character set is not provided, these commands will display
  the current setting.  If you pass a dash ("-") as the character set name,
  the setting will revert to the default character set.

  <div class="figure">
    <table class="figure-contents" cellpadding="2px">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>/charset</code></td>

          other more specific charset preference has been set.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>/network-charset</code></td>
        <td>
          Selects the character set for the current network, including any
          channel or query view on that network.  This charset is used when no
          other channel or user specific charset preference has been set.

      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>/channel-charset</code></td>

<entry id="log">
<question>
  How do I enable logging?
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla logging can be enabled at a number of levels.  The most
  straightforward way to turn on logging for a specific view is to
  type <tt>/log on</tt> from the view in question.
  
  <div class="figure">
    <div class="figure-contents">
      <ul>
        <li>To log the current view, type
            <tt>/log on</tt>, type <tt>/log off</tt> to stop logging.
        </li>
        <li>To log all channel views by default, type
            <tt>/pref channelLog true</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>To log all network views by default, type
            <tt>/pref networkLog true</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>To log all query views by default, type
            <tt>/pref userLog true</tt>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    Logging related preferences
  </div>

  Note that you may override any of the defaults by using the <tt>/log</tt>
  command on the view in question.
  <p/>
  By default, ChatZilla stores logs in the <tt>logs/</tt> subdirectory of your
  ChatZilla profile path.  Type <tt>/pref logFileName</tt> to see where this
  is.  You may modify the logFileName pref, but it will not copy over your old
  logs.

<question id="nick-complete">
  Does ChatZilla have nickname completion?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  Type enough of a person's nickname to make it unique and press the
  <b>tab</b> key.
  <p/>
  If the name is not unique, ChatZilla will append any characters that it
  has in common with other matching nicknames.
  <p/>
  If you press <b>tab</b> twice, quickly, then ChatZilla will display all
  matching nicknames.
  <p/>
  From network and query views, you can tab complete on any nickname in
  any channel on the same network.  From channel views, only users in the
  same channel will be included in the tab complete operation.
  <p/>
  In addition to nicknames, you can tab complete any channel you are on
  (or have been on) on the same network.  If you attempt to tab complete
  only the character "#", ChatZilla will assume you meant the current
  channel.
  <p/>
  There is a default tab completion for channel tabs.  If you press
  <b>tab</b> on an empty line, ChatZilla will match the last person to
  trigger your <a href="#stalk">stalk</a> function.
  
  <div class="figure">
    <div class="figure-contents">

  Assuming that <i>rginda_home</i> and <i>rginda_work</i> are members
  of the current channel:

  <ol>
    <li>Type <tt>rg</tt> and press <b>tab</b>.  ChatZilla responds by
        completing <tt>rginda_</tt>.  ChatZilla stops completing here, because
        there are two nicknames that start with these characters.
    </li>
    <li>Press <b>tab</b> twice, quickly.  ChatZilla responds by displaying the
        message ``2 matches for &#8220;rginda_&#8221;:
        [rginda_home, rginda_work]''.
    </li>
    <li>Add an <tt>h</tt>, and <b>tab</b>.  If this is the first word in
        the textbox, ChatZilla responds by completing
        ``<tt>rginda_home, </tt>''.  If this is <b>not</b> the first word,
        ChatZilla will leave out the comma.

<question id="cmd-complete">
  Does ChatZilla have command completion?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  It works just like nickname completion.  If the cursor is in the
  first word of the text, and the first character is a forward slash ("/"),
  then ChatZilla will automatically match against commands, instead of
  users or channels.
  <p/>
  You don't actually need to type the entire command name, however.  ChatZilla
  will allow you to shorten the command just enough to make the name
  unique.

<question id="copy">
  Why do some messages appear in the network tab?
</question>

<answer>
  Those messages have been copied there because they matched your 
  <a href="#stalk">stalk</a> list.  The reasoning here is that, if you're
  away from the computer for a long time, important messages might have
  scrolled off the view by the time you get back.  Copying the
  message to the network tab makes sure you don't miss anything important.  It's
  also a quick way to catch up after being away for a while.
  <p/>
  The <b>View</b>-&gt;<b>Copy Important Messages</b> menu item can be used to
  disable this feature.
</answer>

<entry>
<question id="timestamp">
  Where are the timestamps?
</question>
  
<answer>
  Timestamps appear in the statusbar when you mouse over messages.  There
  isn't yet an option to display them in the message, but it's a popular
  request and will likely be implemented sooner or later.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry>
<question id="stalk">
  What is a stalk list?
</question>

<answer>
  A stalk list is a list of words or nicknames that you want ChatZilla to
  consider important.  Important messages are treated differently than
  normal messages.  For example:
  <ul>
    <li>The message will likely be styled differently in the message window.
    </li>
    <li>If you have ``Copy Important Messages'' enabled, the message will be
        copied to its associated network view.
    </li>
    <li>The channel's tab label will turn red, if it's not already the
        current tab.  
    </li>
    <li>ChatZilla may beep, or play a .wav file.  You can adjust this setting
        through the <tt>stalkBeep</tt> preference.  
    </li>
    <li>The ChatZilla window may try to get your attention.  On some platforms
        this is done by flashing an application icon, on others the window
        may come to the front.  You can adjust this setting with the
        <tt>notify.aggressive</tt> pref.
    </li>
  </ul>
  By default, your nickname is the only entry in your stalk list.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="channel-key">
<question>
  How can I join a channel that requires a key, at startup?
</question>

<answer>
  From the ChatZilla preferences dialog, select the <b>Startup</b> group, add
  a new channel to join at startup, and specify the channel name as
  <tt>channelname?key=keyvalue</tt>.  So, if you wanted to join <tt>#cia</tt>
  with the key <tt>tenet</tt> at startup, you would specify the channel name as
  <tt>cia?key=tenent</tt>.

<question id="nick">
  How do I set my nickname?
</question>

<answer>
  When you first connect to a server with ChatZilla, you are prompted to enter
  a nickname.  If you would like to change it later, use the <tt>/nick</tt>
  command.  ChatZilla automatically remembers your last nickname for
  each network you connect to.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="desc">
<question>
  How do I set my description?
</question>

<answer>
  Your description is a single line of text that other users will see when
  they request information about you.  Many people use it for their full name
  or web site.  Use the <tt>/desc</tt> command to change your description.  The
  description is sent during the login process, so you must reconnect to the
  server for it to take effect.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="autoperform">
<question>
  How do I ``autoperform'' some commands when I connect to a network?
</question>

<answer>
  Each network has an ``autoperform'' preference which consists of a list
  of standard ChatZilla commands.  You can modify this preference with
  the <tt>/network-pref</tt> command, see the example below.  Be aware
  that if you're using this to automatically ``auth'' yourself with a bot or
  service, that your password will be stored in <b>plain text</b> in your
  preferences file.
  <p/>
  Autoperform commands are executed when ChatZilla successfully logs in to
  a network, regardless of how the connection was initiated.  The commands are
  executed before attempting to join any ``Open at Startup'' channels, and
  before attempting to re-join any existing tabs associated with that network.
  <p/>
  <b>This preference was introduced in
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/">ChatZilla 0.9.41</a>.
  It will not work on older versions.</b>

<entry id="reconnect">
<question>
  How do I prevent ChatZilla from auto-reconnecting to a network?
</question>

<answer>
  By default, ChatZilla will reconnect to a network if you are forcibly
  disconnected.  On networks with idle time limits, this can earn you a
  temporary ban.
  <p/>
  If you would like to turn this off by default, type
  <tt>/pref reconnect false</tt>.  If you would like to turn it off only
  for a particular network, type <tt>/network-pref reconnect false</tt> from
  any tab associated with the network in question.

  Note that if you change the default to <tt>false</tt>, you can still
  override specific networks with the <tt>/network-pref</tt> command.

   userContent.css rule for 12pt font
  </div>
  If your fonts are way too large or way too small, it is likely a problem with
  your DPI setting.  Check your display preferences.  If you're set to use
  "System Setting", try one of the pre-defined DPI settings instead.  In
  practice, it seems that "System Setting" is almost always wrong.  Fixing this
  will likely help out with web pages that specify font sizes in points, too.
  <p/>
  If it's not a DPI thing, you can adjust your font size with a special
  rule in <b>userContent.css</b>.  In the <tt>chrome/</tt> subdirectory of your
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=(mozilla%20OR%20firebird)%20profile%20directory">profile directory</a>,

<entry id="set-motif">
<question>
  How do I change the color scheme of the message window?
</question>
<answer>
  From the <b>View</b> menu, open the <b>Color Scheme</b> submenu.  ChatZilla
  comes
  with three color schemes, known as "motifs".  <b>Default Motif</b> uses your
  default fore and background colors, and specifies no colors of its own.
  <b>Dark Motif</b> is a back background on white text, with some appropriate
  colors
  for various message types.  <b>Light Motif</b> is the opposite, using
  white as the background color, and black for message text.
  <p/>
  The <tt>/motif</tt> command can be used to select a CSS file by means of an
  ordinary http: or file: URL.  For example, the command
  <tt>/motif http://example.host.com/cool-color-scheme.css</tt> would be used
  to select the "cool-color-scheme.css" motif from "example.host.com".
  <p/>
  You may also use <tt>/network-motif</tt>, <tt>/channel-motif</tt>, and
  <tt>/user-motif</tt> commands to set a motif for a particular tab, or
  group of tabs.  See the <a href="#multiple-motifs">multiple motifs

<entry id="faces-motif">
<question>
  How do I show faces in ChatZilla?

<answer>
  There is a motif available that displays pictures next to the nicknames
  of many of the moznet people.  You can find information on
  how to use this motif at the

</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="multiple-motifs">
<question>
  Can I use different motifs for different channels?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  The <tt>/network-motif</tt>, <tt>/channel-motif</tt>, and
  <tt>/user-motif</tt> commands can be used to choose a motif for a
  particular tab or group of tabs.  For example, you might use a
  <a href="#faces-mofit">faces motif</a> on the moznet network, but a "plain"
  motif for dalnet.
  <p/>
  If you've got some web space (no CGI required) you can publish a
  <a href="#make-motif">CSS file</a> specially tailored to your channel.
  This could be as easy as picking a custom background image and a
  matching color scheme.  (You will also need to host any images.)
  Users can try out your motif by typing one of the <tt>/*-motif</tt>
  commands listed above, followed by the URL to the CSS file on your web site.
  Users may also drag a link to a CSS file into the ChatZilla message area, to
  use that file as the <b>default</b> motif.

<entry id="make-motif">
<question>
  How do I make my own color scheme?

<answer>
  The ChatZilla output window is styled with standard CSS.  Messages in the
  output window are nothing more than elements in an HTML table.  Those elements
  have attributes on them which identify who sent the message and what type of
  message it is.  You can then style specific messages using

<entry id="output-window">
<question>
  Can I make my own HTML file for the output window?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  By replacing the HTML file
  ChatZilla displays messages in, you can make an unlimited number of
  customizations for the output window.
  Because the output window has access to all
  of Mozilla, including XPCOM, it can do anything ChatZilla can.  This includes
  redisplaying information scraped from the web, state stored in a bot
  of some sort, or just about anything else.
  For security reasons these replacement ``output windows''
  cannot be remotely located, and must instead be
  <a href="#install-scripts">installed</a> by users.
  <p/>
  The ``outputWindowURL'' pref is used to select the output window file
  to use for a particular network, channel, or user.  See the
  default
  <a href="view-source:http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/output-window.html">output-window.html</a>
  and
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/output-window.js">output-window.js</a>
  for more clues.
  <p/>
  This hasn't gotten much use as of yet, but the basic idea is to make your
  own <b>output-window.html</b>, but use the stock <b>output-window.js</b>.
  JavaScript
  customizations should go in a new .js file, included in a &lt;script&gt;
  tag in your custom output-window.html.

<entry id="scripts">
<question>
  How do I script ChatZilla?
</question>
<answer>
  With JavaScript!  ChatZilla is written entirely in JavaScript, and has
  provisions for loading (and unloading) plugins written in same.  Because
  ChatZilla itself is written in JavaScript, plugins are not much more than
  additional ChatZilla code, and can therefore do anything ChatZilla can do.
  <p/>
  There are a number of convenience functions for adding new commands, new
  menus, or just hooking existing events.  While these techniques have yet
  to be well documented, there are a number of samples available.  The
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/scripts/sample/init.js">sample plugin</a>
  shows the basics of how to define new commands and place them in menus.
  <p/>
  The application framework that ChatZilla is built on was originally developed
  for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">Venkman</a>.  I gave
  a techtalk during that time that described how to use the framework to extend
  Venkman.  The
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/venkman/techtalk/">notes</a> are
  online, and may prove useful.
  <p/>
  The source of ChatZilla itself provides a number of examples of how to use
  the framework:
  <ul>
    <li>
      For a list of default menus in ChatZilla, see
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/menus.js">menus.js</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      For examples of the default commands, see
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/commands.js">commands.js</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Default preferences are defined in
      <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/prefs.js">prefs.js</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Internationalizable command strings, such as help text, UI labels, and
      parameter lists are stored in 
      <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/locale/en-US/chatzilla.properties">chatzilla.properties</a>.

<entry id="install-script">
<question>
  How do I install a third party script in ChatZilla?
</question>
<answer>
  ChatZilla searches all subdirectories in your
  <tt>&lt;profile-path&gt;/chatzilla/scripts</tt> directory for files named
  <tt>init.js</tt>.  Any files found there are loaded at startup.  To install
  a script that someone else wrote, just copy it into a file called
  <tt>init.js</tt> in a new subdirectory of <tt>chatzilla/scripts</tt>.  To
  find out where <tt>&lt;profile-path&gt;</tt> is on your system, type
  <tt>/pref profilePath</tt>.
  <p/>
  ChatZilla will also load <tt>chatzilla/scripts/init.js</tt> at startup, if
  it exists.  It is recommended that you use this for one-off, personal 
  scripts, or for any script that might need to make sure it is the first one
  loaded.

<entry id="prefs">
<question>
  How do I tweak the rest of the preferences?
</question>

<answer>
  There are two ways.  The first, and easiest, is to use the prefs dialog.
  Select <b>Edit</b>-&gt;<b>Preferences</b>, ChatZilla preferences will be displayed
  under the ChatZilla group.  Unfortunately, there are a few bugs in the pref
  panel.  Some settings, like the text transformation prefs, do not take
  effect until ChatZilla has been restarted.
  <p/>
  If you want more control, want access to "hidden" prefs, or want to set
  network, channel, or user specific preferences, use the <tt>/pref</tt>
  command, or
  one of the variants.  Type <tt>/pref</tt> to list all of the global
  preferences.
  You may provide a pref name, or just the first few letters of a pref name, to
  see the current value of matching preferences.  To change a preference, type
  <tt>/pref pref-name new-value</tt>.  To edit a preference for a specific
  network, channel, or user, use <tt>/network-pref</tt>, <tt>/channel-pref</tt>,
  or <tt>/user-pref</tt>.  There are network, channel, and user specific
  variants of the <tt>/charset</tt> and <tt>/motif</tt> commands as well.
