      Looking for a way to give something back to the people who bring you
      ChatZilla?  There are plenty of ways you can help out.
      This list isn't complete, of course.  If you can think of some other

        <td><b>Cold, hard cash</b>
          <p>
            We don't ask much, really.  We just want to pitch in
            for the bandwidth on hacksrus.com, send out schwag to contributors
            in various parts of the world, and maybe get a beer or two.
            Donations are accepted via PayPal, click on the donate button below
            and enter your dollar amount.  It's the fastest and easiest way
            to contribute, and requires no special skill on your part :)

             If you follow the image below to Amazon.com, anything you buy
             during that session will generate some cash for ChatZilla.  So
             go buy yourself a new HDTV and tell your wife you did it for
             the good of open source software.

          <p>
            OmniStep is a consulting business run by a close friend of mine.
            They've been providing web space for ChatZilla since the beginning
            (more than four years now), and besides that, he's a really smart
            guy.  If you need a project done, talk to Rolan Yang at
            <a href="http://omnistep.com/main.html">OmniStep, Inc.</a>

            for the FAQ, write user documentation, developer documentation,
            or whatever else you can think of.  If you're going to start a
            large undertaking, you may want to announce it on the
            <a href="faq/chatzilla-faq.html#ng">newsgroup</a>.

          <b>Scrub the bug list</b>
          <p>
            If you're familiar with both ChatZilla and Bugzilla, you
            could help run range over the list of
            <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&email1=&emailtype1=substring&emailassigned_to1=1&email2=&emailtype2=substring&emailreporter2=1&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&changedin=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&component=chatzilla&short_desc=&short_desc_type=substring&long_desc=&long_desc_type=substring&bug_file_loc=&bug_file_loc_type=substring&status_whiteboard=&status_whiteboard_type=substring&keywords=&keywords_type=anywords&cmdtype=doit&newqueryname=&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time">open bugs</a>.
            Some of these bugs have been fixed but never marked as such,
            some no longer apply, and some should be getting more attention
            then they do.  Please, familiarize yourself
            with the entire bug list before trying to help out here.  If you're
            not sure about something, ask in
            <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla</a> first.

          <b>Fix bugs</b>
          <p>
            Once you're familiar with the bug list, you might want to try
            your hand at fixing some of them.  You'll need to know a bit
            of JavaScript first, of course.  For small fixes you can probably
            work from the chatzilla.jar file installed in your browser.  For
            anything larger than a few lines though, you'll want to check
            out <tt>mozilla/extensions/irc</tt> from the Mozilla CVS
            repository.
            The FAQ has
            <a href="faq/chatzilla-faq.html#source">an entry</a> that
            describes where to find the source.  We can help you out in
            <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla</a> when
            questions come up.
