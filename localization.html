    <h1>Localizing ChatZilla</h1>
    <p>
      So, you want to try and localize ChatZilla? Good on you! This page is here
      to try and give you an idea how to go about things. If you have questions,
      or just trouble getting things to work at all, feel free to drop by on
        <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla on moznet</a>
      and ask.</p>

    <h2>What this page is</h2>
    <p>
      This page aims to give you an idea of the easiest way to build a
      localization xpi for ChatZilla. It requires some setting up on Windows and
      Mac OS X platforms, but should be (nearly) painless on a *nix system. Even
      on Windows and Mac, the effort will be worth it in the end (unless you
      enjoy manually constructing your jar and xpi files every time something
      changes).</p>

    <h2>What this page is not</h2>
    <p>
      This page does NOT provide all-out guides to CVS, Bash, or language
      problems (wording choices etcetera). It also doesn't apply to localizing
      the SeaMonkey Suite - if you want help with that,
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/l10n/">the l10n information
                                                        pages</a>
      may be of more assistance to you.</p>

    <h2>Requirements for the method described below.</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Windows</strong>:<br>
         This is probably worst of them all. You need to get
         <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>. Install at least the
         following packages when presented with the horribly badly done list in
         its installer:
         <ul>
           <li>coreutils</li>
           <li>cvs</li>
           <li>sed</li>
           <li>perl (optionally, you can not install this and use ActiveState
             perl instead)</li>
           <li>zip</li>
           <li>bash</li>
         </ul>
         Now, hopefully, you're setup after installing all this. Hopefully.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>Mac</strong>:<br>
         You'll need to install
         <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">fink</a>.<br>
         Using fink from the command line, install the <tt>cvs</tt> package. If
         everything went alright during the original install, the <tt>perl</tt>,
         <tt>sed</tt>, <tt>bash</tt> and <tt>zip</tt> packages were already
         installed.
       </li>
       <li><strong>Linux/Unix</strong>:<br>
         Simple, you need to get the following packages from your distribution:
         <ul>
           <li>cvs</li>
           <li>perl</li>
           <li>bash</li>
           <li>sed</li>
           <li>zip</li>
         </ul>
         Since all of those come pre-installed with most distributions, you're
         probably done already.
       </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 1: Checkout the source</h2>
      <p>
        First things first: make sure you have everything listed in the
        requirements above, and open a terminal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On <strong>Windows</strong>:<br><br>
            <tt>Start &gt; Run &gt; Type 'cmd' in the box and hit Return</tt>
            <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            On <strong>Mac</strong>:<br><br>
            <tt>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal</tt><br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            On <strong>Linux/Unix</strong> you should be so familiar with
            terminals that I need not explain it here.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have opened a terminal, set the CVSROOT environment variable
        to the mozilla cvs repository. Commands to do so are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On <strong>Windows</strong>:<br><br>
            <kbd>set CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot</kbd>
            <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            On <strong>Mac</strong> and <strong>Linux/Unix</strong>:<br><br>
            <kbd>CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot</kbd><br><br>
            (Note that I'm assuming you're running a bash shell. On Mac, you
            will be running that unless you changed preferences. On Linux/Unix,
            you might need to start bash from your ash/tcsh/something-else
            shell)
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Now you can checkout the ChatZilla source. Navigate to a folder where
        you want to store your localization work using the '<kbd>cd</kbd>'
        command. Then execute the following command:<br><br>
        <kbd>cvs co mozilla/extensions/irc</kbd><br><br>
        This will get you the ChatZilla source. You'll see lots of filenames
        flashing by, and after a (hopefully short) while it will be done.
        Now, to actually build ChatZilla, you need some other files as well.
        These are not part of the source, but they are required to get the build
        script to work properly. To get those files, use the following command:
        <br><br>
        <kbd>cvs co mozilla/config</kbd><br><br>
        Now you have all the source code you need, so let's get going!
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Making a locale directory</h2>
      <p>
        To get started on your localization, you'll want to copy the contents of
        the 'en-US' directory in <tt>mozilla/extensions/irc/xul/locale</tt> into
        a new subdirectory there. The new subdirectory should be named after the
        locale you're writing a localization for. Examples are <tt>de-DE</tt>
        for German, or <tt>fr-FR</tt> for French.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Localize all the files in your new directory.</h2>
      <p>
        The single chatzilla.properties file and all the .dtd files will need
        to be localized in order for your localization to be complete. The
        chatzilla.properties file is probably hardest, because it is so big.
        To get things right, there are a couple of things you need to watch out
        for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>NEVER</strong> localize the cmd.&lt;something&gt;.params
            strings. These are for internal use, translating them will prevent
            the use of those commands! You can, however, translate the
            cmd.&lt;something&gt;.help strings. These will prove useful to users
            when they are unsure what a command is about.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do <strong>NOT</strong> change the locale.version string. This too
            is for internal use. For more information, please refer to the
            comment at the top of the chatzilla.properties file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep up with changes in ChatZilla. There should be new releases
            every now and then. Lingering in #chatzilla on moznet when on IRC
            is probably the best way of getting an idea when these are going to
            happen. We will release from the code in CVS (you know, where you
            got your source code from) every now and then. It would be wise
            to archive releases you have made yourself, and keep up with
            development on CVS. Silver (James Ross) has made a
            <a href="http://twpol.dyndns.org/mozilla/chatzilla/nightly">nifty
                                                                        page</a>
            which will list any locale changes made to the ChatZilla code.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Prepare installation files for your locale package</h2>
      <p>
        To actually make a locale package, you'll have to do some more things.
        If you look in the <tt>mozilla/extensions/irc/xpi/locale-resources/</tt>
        directory, you'll notice a bunch of install files that you need to copy
        to a new subdirectory based on your locale. If you were localizing
        ChatZilla into French, you'd copy the files to the directory<br><br>
        <tt>mozilla/extensions/irc/xpi/locale-resources/fr-FR/</tt><br><br>
        <strong>After</strong> copying these files, you should edit them
        as described in the comments at the top of the files. <strong>Make
        sure to change the UUID in install.rdf</strong>. Also note that you
        should change this UUID once, but keep it the same afterwards -
        otherwise updates to your localization won't install properly.<br>
        UUID generators may be found in any of the following places:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=94551F58-484F-4A8C-BB39-ADB270833AFC&displaylang=en">Microsoft guidgen.exe utility</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://kruithof.xs4all.nl/uuid/uuidgen">Web-based UUID
                                                             generator</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            For the Linux people, your package managing software usually knows
            about 'libuuid', 'libuuid1' or 'e2fsprogs', which will install a
            utility called 'uuidgen'. That will do the job fine as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            On moznet, the following command will also give you a uuid:<br>
            <kbd>/msg firebot uuid</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Microsoft Visual Studio also ships with a uuidgen utility.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Step 5: Make a locale package</h2>
      <p>When you're done localizing, or just want to try if things work, you
        can build a localized xpi file of ChatZilla by opening a terminal in the
        <tt>mozilla/extensions/irc/xpi</tt> directory in the source code, and
        using the following command:<br><br>
        <kbd>bash makelocalexpi.sh ab-CD</kbd><br><br>
        where 'ab-CD' is of course the locale code for the localization you did,
        and the name of the directory in which your localization is saved.
        If all goes well, you should see a bunch of messages appear in your
        terminal (but no errors), and a 
        chatzilla-&lt;locale&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.xpi file should have been
        created in the <tt>mozilla/extensions/irc/xpi</tt> directory.<br><br>
        This xpi file installs <strong>only</strong> your localization - that
        means that users will have to have installed the ChatZilla code from
        the website. It will also mean that this package could, theoretically,
        also be used by SeaMonkey users to localize their pre-installed
        ChatZilla.</p>
