    <ul>
      <li>
        A lot has happened recently, and <b>ChatZilla 0.9.69.2</b> is now out.
        The big issues currently are
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321195">motifs
        not displaying properly</a> and the
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=318419">timer
        problem</a> - luckly we've managed to get the first one fixed (for
        Firefox 1.5.0.1), and are making good headway with the second one.
        These are both Firefox (Gecko) bugs, but they only affect us seriously,
        which is why we get to do all the hard work!
      </li>
      <li>
        The other news is that starting with ChatZilla 0.9.69.2, 1% of all new
        users will be asked to enabled a "startup ping", which will send the
        client's version to one of our developer's servers each time it starts.
        Nothing except the client version, and the name and version of the host
        app (Firefox, Mozilla, XULRunner) is sent - certainly nothing that
        could identify the user - and there is the option to not send the ping.
        This data should help us to identify what people are doing with
        ChatZilla - do they run it on older versions of Mozilla, for example,
        and how long they take to upgrade to the newest release. We should
        also be able to estimate the number of active users, which is much
        more useful that the simple "download count" we currently have.

        <b>Firefox 0.9 support added</b>.
        With Firefox 0.9 being released in just a few days, we've now fixed 
        the majority of issues with ChatZilla running on current versions of
        the Mozilla Firefox browser.
        <i>Update, June 17, 2004: some more compatibility fixes have been 
        made, including fixing opening URLs in a new window.</i>

        240552</a> blocks XPInstall from "untrusted" hosts, which means you
        can no longer install ChatZilla directly from this website with 
        Mozilla 1.7 and newer. Instead, you need to download the XPI files 
        and open them in Mozilla on your computer.

        It took some time, but it's finally working. Anyone who uses ChatZilla
        in Mozilla Firefox should check out version <b>0.9.54c</b> or later, 
        and we'd love to hear suggestions for making it better. <i>Note: all
        versions since <b>0.9.63</b> have this feature as standard, and work
