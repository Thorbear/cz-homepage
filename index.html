    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <div class="bodytext">
      <p>
        ChatZilla is a cross platform messaging client that combines 
        Internet Relay Chat (IRC) with existing web standards like JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS.  If you don't know any of this stuff don't worry, you
        don't have to.  ChatZilla is easy to use.  For more information, please
        read the <a href="faq/chatzilla-faq.html">FAQ</a>.

    <ul>
      <li>
        This is just a heads-up for those of you that use the
        latest-and-greatest SeaMonkey or Firefox builds (usually called
        "nightly builds") - a change in the HTML parser rendered ChatZilla
        rather broken. We've already fixed the code, but until a new official
        release is out, you'll need to <a href="#nightly">fetch a nightly
        ChatZilla build</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="newsitem">
      <b>January 11, 2006</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A lot has happened recently, and <b>ChatZilla 0.9.69.2</b> is now out.
        The big issues currently are
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321195">motifs
        not displaying properly</a> and the
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=318419">timer
        problem</a> - luckly we've managed to get the first one fixed (for
        Firefox 1.5.0.1), and are making good headway with the second one.
        These are both Firefox (Gecko) bugs, but they only affect us seriously,
        which is why we get to do all the hard work!
      </li>
      <li>
        The other news is that starting with ChatZilla 0.9.69.2, 1% of all new
        users will be asked to enabled a "startup ping", which will send the
        client's version to one of our developer's servers each time it starts.
        Nothing except the client version, and the name and version of the host
        app (Firefox, Mozilla, XULRunner) is sent - certainly nothing that
        could identify the user - and there is the option to not send the ping.
        This data should help us to idenify what people are doing with
        ChatZilla - do they run it on older versions of Mozilla, for example,
        and how long they take to upgrade to the newest release. We should
        also be able to estimate the number of active users, which is much
        more useful that the simple "download count" we currently have.

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
      Click on one of the the "install" links below to install or upgrade
      ChatZilla.  Please note:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ChatZilla does not work on "native" Mozilla embeddings such as
        <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon</a> and
        <a href="http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/">K-Meleon</a>.  Same goes for
        <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22blue+screen+of+death%22&btnG=Google+Search">Internet Explorer</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depending on how you installed Mozilla, you may need to log in as
        <tt>root</tt> or <tt>Administrator</tt>.      
      </li>
      <li>
        ChatZilla is also available in
