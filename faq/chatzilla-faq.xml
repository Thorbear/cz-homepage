  How do I install ChatZilla?
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla is currently distributed with Mozilla, and is available as an
  extension to Mozilla Firefox.
  If you download the
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">latest Mozilla release</a>,
  select <b>Full</b> or <b>Custom</b> when installing to get ChatZilla.
  <p/>
  If you're running Netscape 7.x, or already have Mozilla or Firefox
  installed and simply want to add or upgrade ChatZilla, visit the
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/">ChatZilla Development Page</a>.
  Alternatively, some versions may be available via the
  <a href="https://addons.update.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Update</a> site.
  <p/>
  On all platforms, you will need to restart your browser after installing.
  On all versions of Windows, you will need to exit the quick launch icon on
  your taskbar as well, and on <b>some</b> versions of Windows, you may need to
  restart the operating system.

<question>
  How do I start ChatZilla?
</question>

<answer>
  <ul>
    <li>You can start ChatZilla from <menu>Window<submenu/>IRC Chat</menu> 
      in the Mozilla Suite, and from <menu>Tools<submenu/>ChatZilla</menu>
      in Mozilla Firefox.
    </li>
    <li>In Mozilla Firefox, you can also place an <b>ChatZilla</b> button on
      your toolbar.
    </li>
    <li>You can also start the browser with the <tt>-chat</tt> command line
      option.  This will launch ChatZilla instead of a browser front end.
    </li>
    <li>You can type an IRC URL in the URL bar. Type just <tt>irc:</tt>
      to launch ChatZilla and connect to your default channels.  Note that 
      you can bookmark this URL, and file it wherever it to make sense to you.
    </li>
    <li>Of course, you can use any IRC URL to start ChatZilla and make it
      connect to the specified location, however, the default channels will
      not be joined for anything other than <tt>irc:</tt>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <note>In some rare occasions, a bug in the Mozilla Firefox extension
  manager will disable the ChatZilla extension right after installing, even
  though the item does not show disabled in the list. If you can not start
  ChatZilla as described above (for example, you may get a message saying the
  IRC protocol is not registered), try disabling ChatZilla, restarting Firefox,
  re-enabled ChatZilla, and restarting Firefox again.</note>

      Commands to connect to a server
  </div>
  ChatZilla allows you to be connected to multiple servers at once, so unlike
  some other clients, <tt>/server</tt> will <b>not disconnect you</b> from
  your current server.  You can manually do that with the <tt>/disconnect</tt>
  command.
  <p/>
  <a name="network"></a>
  ChatZilla comes preset with a few popular irc networks.  Use the
  <tt>/networks</tt> command to list the available networks.  You may click
  on a network name or use the <tt>/network</tt> command to connect to a network
  by name.
  <p/>
  <a name="attach"></a>
  The more general <tt>/attach</tt> command accepts an
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/irc-urls.html">irc: URL</a>
  as a parameter.  You may omit the <tt>irc://</tt> prefix, however.  This
  can be used to connect to a network and channel with a single command,
  such as <tt>/attach moznet/chatzilla</tt>, or
  <tt>/attach moznet/killer,isnick</tt>.

<entry id="connect-issues">
<question>
  What do I do if I get an error connecting?
</question>
<answer>
  Firstly, it depends on the error.  The most common reasons are the wrong
  address for the server, or a firewall mis-configuration.  The following list
  will hopefully cover the error you have, but if you are getting a different
  error try to connect to <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla</a>
  on <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/">irc.mozilla.org</a> and we'll help you
  resolve the problem.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Unknown host ``irc.example.com'' connecting to
      irc://irc.example.com/ (irc.example.com:6667).</tt><br/>
      This error means that ChatZilla could not find a physical address for the
      name given.  It is most likely that the <b>server name specified is not
      correct</b>, although it could be a problem with the DNS configuration for
      the server's host or a local DNS problem.  Try going to the website for
      the server or network, if you can find one, and check that the name you
      used is correct.
    </li>
    <li><tt>Connection to irc://irc.example.com/ (irc.example.com:6667)
      timed out.</tt><br/>
      This error means that the server's name was turned into a physical
      address, but nothing responded when that address was contacted.  A
      <b>firewall blocking the connection</b> is the usual cause of this error;
      try temporarily disabling your firewall, if you have one, to see if that
      helps.  If you have no firewall, or disabling it does not help, the
      IRC server is probably down.
    </li>
    <li><tt>Connection to irc://irc.example.com/ (irc.example.com:6667)
      refused.</tt><br/>
      This error means that the server <i>was</i> found, but it did not wish
      to let you connect.  This could be because the wrong port (6667 in this
      example) was used; verify that the server is not on a different port
      (especially if you are trying to connect using SSL) and try again.  This
      error could also mean that the server is having a temporary technical
      problem.
    </li>
    <li><tt>Connection to irc://irc.example.com/ (irc.example.com:6667)
      reset.</tt><br/>
      This error means that ChatZilla was able to connect to the server
      initially, but the connection was then <b>severed by the remote server</b>.
      This is usually nothing to do with either end of the connection directly,
      but instead a link between you and the server; possible causes include
      a reset or reboot of your DSL router, or a local network configuration
      change.
    </li>
    <li><tt>ERROR Closing Link: irc.example.com (Install IdentD)</tt><br/>
      This message, sometimes worded differently (but will always mention
      "ident" or "identd"), means that the server you tried to connect to
      requires a <a href="#ident">special identification service</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="ident">
<question>
  How do I enable 'ident'?
</question>

<answer>
  Some servers will require you to be running an "ident server" to connect to
  them, even though this service is only useful if you run a multi-user
  computer (where many people can connect and share a single computer).
  
  <tip>Some networks only have a few servers that require ident. Trying
    specific servers may let you connect without ident.</tip>
  <p/>
  ChatZilla does not have any ident server. If, however, you are required to
  have such a service to connect to a particular server, you should simply
  install a standalone ident client (which can be found via
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ident+server">Google</a>).

</entry>

<entry id="join">
<question>
  How do I join a channel?
</question>

<answer>
  Once you have <a href="#connect">connected to a server</a>, you can join a
  channel by typing <tt>/join</tt> followed by the channel name.  For example,
  if you want to join <tt>#worldchat</tt> on <tt>undernet</tt>, you would
  first connect to undernet with the <a href="#network"><tt>/network</tt></a>,
  <a href="#server"><tt>/server</tt></a> or <a href="#attach"><tt>/attach</tt></a>
  command (e.g. <tt>/attach undernet</tt>), then type <tt>/join #worldchat</tt>.
  <p/>
  If you omit the channel prefix, ChatZilla will prepend a "<tt>#</tt>"
  automatically.
  <p/>
  The command <tt>/j</tt> comes predefined as an alias for <tt>/join</tt>.
</answer>
</entry>

<entry id="list">
<question>
  How can I list the available channels on a server?
</question>

<answer>
  Use <menu>File<submenu/>Join channel...</menu> to open a dialog that will
  list all channels on the current network.  You can join an existing channel
  or create a new channel from this dialog, filter channels by name, topic, and
  exclude channels with more, or less, than a certain number of users.  On
  large networks, however, this dialog may have more difficulty in operating
  (coping with 200,000 channels is not easy).

  <note>This dialog was added in ChatZilla <b>0.9.67</b> and is not available
  in earlier versions.</note>

  The <code>/list</code> command can be used to fetch a list of all channels on
  the current network.  On large networks, however, this may take a very long
  time.  On some networks, you'll be kicked off with a message like ``Excess
  Flood'' for doing this.  Adding to the confusion, some networks recognize
  extended <code>/list</code> options for filtering based on number of
  users in a channel, etc. (if you need such features, try the join dialog
  mentioned above).
  <p/>
  ChatZilla also offers an <code>/rlist</code> command, which can be used to
  filter the result list based on the channel name, regardless of the
  server software.  Type <code>/help rlist</code> for more information.

<entry id="hide-ip">
<question>
  How can I hide my IP address from other users?
</question>

<answer>
  In general you can't.  The way IRC works, your IP address is distributed to
  every user you communicate with.  Depending on where you hang out, and who
  your enemies are, this may or may not be a problem.  In practice, it's not a
  problem for most normal users.
  <p/>
  However, an increasing number of servers are supporting a user mode
  "<tt>x</tt>" which hides your hostname (and thus your IP) from other users
  (IRC Operators can still see your real host, however). You can start using
  this user mode by adding "<tt>x</tt>" to the Usermode box on the General tab
  in preferences, either in <b>Global Settings</b>, or for individual servers.
  <note>Remember that not all servers support this. Ones that don't will
  simply ignore it, so don't worry about adding it if you're not sure.</note>

<entry id="charset">
<question>
  How do I select a character set? (and why can't other users read my text?)
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla allows you to select character encodings at multiple levels.  The
  default character encoding used by ChatZilla is UTF-8, and it is recommended
  that you leave this setting wherever possible.  This default avoids a number
  of unsolvable problems, such as how to know what encoding has been used for
  particular  channel names without proir knowledge.
  
  <tip>The most common character encoding is ISO-8859-15, since this is what
  mIRC uses normally (it can also do Shift-JIS for Japanese). If you are
  unsure, or other members of the channel are clueless, try using ISO-8859-15
  first (type <tt>/charset ISO-8859-15</tt> on the channel view).</tip>
  
  An unfortunate problem with the way IRC works is that international (and 
  most non-US-ASCII) characters cannot be sent without encoding them.  The 
  problem is that there are many, many different character encodings 
  available, and different systems and programs use different ones.  To help 
  alleviate this problem, ChatZilla supports many different character 
  encodings, and lets you select the right one for each channel and server.
  
  <p/>
  If text is showing up with a lot of question-marks (?) or completely 
  unexpected characters (for example, Japanese characters in a Danish channel)
  then it is likely that ChatZilla is not using the same charset as the other
  client(s).  The table below lists the charset commands available in ChatZilla.
  Each of these commands takes a case-insensitive character encoding name as a
  parameter.  If a character encoding is not provided, these commands will
  display the current setting.  If you pass a dash ("-") as the character
  encoding name, the setting will revert to the default character encoding.

  <div class="figure">
    <table class="figure-contents" cellpadding="2px">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>/default-charset</code></td>
        <td>
          Selects the default character encoding for all networks, channels,
          and users.  This charset is used when no other more specific charset 
          preference has been set.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>/charset</code></td>
        <td>
          Selects the character encoding for the current view, and works from
          all views.  When changing the network charset all channels and query
          views will inherit the value unless it is set on the specific
          channel or query views.

  How do I enable logging?
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla logging can be enabled at a number of levels.  The most
  straightforward way to turn on logging for a specific view is to
  type <tt>/log on</tt> from the view in question.
  
  <div class="figure">
    <div class="figure-contents">
      <ul>
        <li>To log the current view, type
            <tt>/log on</tt>, type <tt>/log off</tt> to stop logging.
        </li>
        <li>To log all channel views by default, type
            <tt>/pref channelLog true</tt>.

  Note that you may override any of the defaults by using the <tt>/log</tt>
  command on the view in question.

  By default, ChatZilla stores logs in the <tt>logs/</tt> subdirectory of your
  ChatZilla profile path.  Type <tt>/pref logFileName</tt> to see where this
  is.  You may modify the logFileName pref, but it will not copy over your old

<question>
  Does ChatZilla have nickname completion?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  Type enough of a person's nickname to make it unique and press the
  <b>tab</b> key.
  <p/>
  If the name is not unique, ChatZilla will append any characters that it
  has in common with other matching nicknames.  If you press <b>tab</b> twice,
  quickly, then ChatZilla will display all matching nicknames.
  <p/>
  From network and query views, you can tab complete on any nickname in
  any channel on the same network.  From channel views, only users in the
  same channel will be included in the tab completion.  In addition to
  nicknames, you can tab complete any channel you are on (or have been on) on
  the same network.
  
  <tip>To complete the current channel name, type only the character "#",
  press the <b>tab</b> key, and ChatZilla will expand it.</tip>
  
  There is a default tab completion for channel tabs.  If you press
  <b>tab</b> on an empty line, ChatZilla will match the last person to
  trigger your <a href="#stalk">stalk</a> function.

<question>
  Does ChatZilla have command completion?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  It works just like nickname completion.  If the cursor is in the
  first word of the text, and the first character is a forward slash ("/"),
  then ChatZilla will automatically match against commands, instead of
  users or channels.

  unique.</tip>

<entry id="copy">
<question>
  Why do some messages appear in the network tab?
</question>

<answer>
  Those messages have been copied there because they matched your 
  <a href="#stalk">stalk</a> list.  The reasoning here is that, if you're
  away from the computer for a long time, important messages might have
  scrolled off the view by the time you get back.  Copying the
  message to the network tab makes sure you don't miss anything important.  It's
  also a quick way to catch up after being away for a while.

<entry id="stalk">
<question>
  What is a stalk list?
</question>

<answer>
  A stalk list is a list of words or nicknames that you want ChatZilla to
  consider important.  Important messages are treated differently than
  normal messages.  For example:
  <ul>
    <li>The message will likely be styled differently in the message window.
    </li>
    <li>If you have ``Copy Important Messages'' enabled, the message will be
        copied to its associated network view.

<answer>
  From the ChatZilla preferences dialog, select <b>Global Settings</b>, then
  the <b>Startup</b> tab, add a new channel to the autoconnect list, and
  specify the channel name as <tt>channelname?key=keyvalue</tt>.  So, if you
  wanted to join <tt>#cia</tt> on the Mozilla network with the key
  <tt>tenent</tt> at startup, you would specify the item as
  <tt>irc://moznet/cia?key=tenent</tt>.

<entry id="colors">
<question>
  How do I use color/bold/underline in my text?
</question>

<answer>
  First of all, you must enable the function - this is to help mark sure 
  you really want colors and aren't just out to annoy people (overly 
  colorful text is a big annoyance to many people). It's usually worth 
  making sure the channel(s) you want to use colors with don't mind, 
  as some channels will kick and possibly ban people who use colors.
  <p/>
  Simply do <code>/pref outgoing.colorCodes true</code> to enable entering
  colors. This setting is saved, so you will only need to do it once.
  <p/>
  To actually  insert colors, bold or underline, you need to enter <tt>%</tt>
  into the input box, then you will get a little popup window reminding you
  what to do. Here is a summary:

<entry id="autoperform">
<question>
  How do I ``autoperform'' some commands when I connect to a network?
</question>

<answer>
  Each network has an ``autoperform'' preference which consists of a list
  of standard ChatZilla commands.  You can modify this preference with
  the preferences window, and the <tt>/network-pref</tt> command, see the
  example below.
  
  <warning>If you're using this to automatically ``auth'' yourself with a bot
  or service, remember that your password will be stored in <b>plain text</b>
  in your preferences file.</warning>
  
  Autoperform commands are executed when ChatZilla successfully logs in to
  a network, regardless of how the connection was initiated.  The commands are
  executed before attempting to join any ``Open at Startup'' channels, and
  before attempting to re-join any existing tabs associated with that network.

<question>
  How do I prevent ChatZilla from auto-reconnecting to a network?

  By default, ChatZilla will reconnect to a network if you are forcibly
  disconnected.  On networks with idle time limits, this can earn you a
  temporary ban.
  <p/>
  If you would like to turn this off by default, type
  <tt>/pref reconnect false</tt>.  If you would like to turn it off only
  for a particular network, type <tt>/network-pref reconnect false</tt> from
  any tab associated with the network in question.

    Summary of Shortcuts
  </div>
  If your fonts are way too large or way too small, it is likely a problem with
  your DPI setting.  Check your display preferences.  If you're set to use
  "System Setting", try one of the pre-defined DPI settings instead.  In
  practice, it seems that "System Setting" is almost always wrong.  Fixing this
  will likely help out with web pages that specify font sizes in points, too.
  <p/>
  If it's not a DPI thing, you can use the options in the menu under 
  <menu>View<submenu/>Font Family and Size</menu>. The options include some
  useful shortcuts (see table to the right) as well as the option to enter a
  size and font name explicitly. <tt>Small</tt>, <tt>Medium</tt> and 
  <tt>Large</tt> are based on the browser's base font size, and the three
  font options (<tt>Serif</tt>, <tt>Sans Serif</tt> and <tt>Monospace</tt>) 
  use the appropriate browser-configured fonts as well.
  <p/>
  For those less inclined to use menus, the commands <tt>/font-size</tt> and
  <tt>/font-family</tt> provide the same functionality. The former accepts the
  text values "default", "small", "medium", "large", "smaller" and "bigger"
  which have the obvious meanings from the menu. The latter command accepts
  the special names "serif", "sans-serif" and "monospace". Both accept other
  values, either the font size in points (pt), or the font family name.
  <p/>
  All these options affect all views in ChatZilla. This doesn't mean you can't
  be awkward and have different sizes or fonts on different views - just use the
  commands described in the <a href="#prefs">preferences</a> entry, and the
  pref names "font.size" and "font.family". For example, if you wanted to make
  the current network use 12pt text instead of the default, you would do 
  <tt>/network-pref font.size 12</tt>.

<entry id="set-motif">
<question>
  How do I change the color scheme of the message window?
</question>
<answer>
  From the <menu>View<submenu/>Color Scheme</menu> menu.  ChatZilla comes
  with three color schemes, known as "motifs".  <b>Default Motif</b> uses your
  default fore and background colors, and specifies no colors of its own.
  <b>Dark Motif</b> is a dark background on white text, with some appropriate
  colors
  for various message types.  <b>Light Motif</b> is the opposite, using
  white as the background color, and black for message text.
  <p/>
  The <tt>/motif</tt> command can be used to select a CSS file by means of an
  ordinary http: or file: URL.  For example, the command
  <tt>/motif http://example.host.com/cool-color-scheme.css</tt> would be used
  to select the "cool-color-scheme.css" motif from "example.host.com".
  <p/>
  You may also use <tt>/network-motif</tt>, <tt>/channel-motif</tt>, and
  <tt>/user-motif</tt> commands to set a motif for a particular tab, or
  group of tabs.  See the <a href="#multiple-motifs">multiple motifs

<entry id="multiple-motifs">
<question>
  Can I use different color schemes for different channels?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  The <tt>/network-motif</tt>, <tt>/channel-motif</tt>, and
  <tt>/user-motif</tt> commands can be used to choose a motif for a
  particular tab or group of tabs.  For example, you might use a
  <a href="#faces-mofit">faces motif</a> on the moznet network, but a "plain"
  motif for dalnet.
  <p/>
  If you've got some web space (no CGI required) you can publish a
  <a href="#make-motif">CSS file</a> specially tailored to your channel.
  This could be as easy as picking a custom background image and a
  matching color scheme.  (You will also need to host any images.)
  Users can try out your motif by typing one of the <tt>/*-motif</tt>
  commands listed above, followed by the URL to the CSS file on your web site.

<entry id="output-window">
<question>
  Can I make my own HTML file for the output window?
</question>

<answer>
  Yes.  By replacing the HTML file
  ChatZilla displays messages in, you can make an unlimited number of
  customizations for the output window.
  Because the output window has access to all
  of Mozilla, including XPCOM, it can do anything ChatZilla can.  This includes
  redisplaying information scraped from the web, state stored in a bot
  of some sort, or just about anything else.
  For security reasons these replacement ``output windows''
  cannot be remotely located, and must instead be
  <a href="#install-script">installed</a> by users.
  <p/>
  The ``outputWindowURL'' pref is used to select the output window file
  to use for a particular network, channel, or user.  See the
  default
  <a href="view-source:http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/output-window.html">output-window.html</a>

  <p/>
  This hasn't gotten much use as of yet, but the basic idea is to make your
  own <b>output-window.html</b>, but use the stock <b>output-window.js</b>.

  customizations should go in a new .js file, included in a &lt;script&gt;

<entry id="scripts">
<question>
  How do I script ChatZilla?
</question>
<answer>
  With JavaScript!  ChatZilla is written entirely in JavaScript, and has
  provisions for loading (and unloading) plugins written in same.  Because
  ChatZilla itself is written in JavaScript, plugins are not much more than
  additional ChatZilla code, and can therefore do anything ChatZilla can do.
  <p/>
  There are a number of convenience functions for adding new commands, new
  menus, or just hooking existing events.  While these techniques have yet
  to be well documented, there are a number of samples available.  The
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/scripts/sample/init.js">sample plugin</a>
  shows the basics of how to define new commands and place them in menus.
  <p/>
  The application framework that ChatZilla is built on was originally developed
  for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">Venkman</a>.  I gave
  a techtalk during that time that described how to use the framework to extend
  Venkman.  The
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/venkman/techtalk/">notes</a> are
  online, and may prove useful.
  <p/>
  The source of ChatZilla itself provides a number of examples of how to use
  the framework:
  <ul>
    <li>
      For a list of default menus in ChatZilla, see
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/menus.js">menus.js</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      For examples of the default commands, see
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/commands.js">commands.js</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Default preferences are defined in
      <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/prefs.js">prefs.js</a>.

  ChatZilla searches all subdirectories in your
  <tt>&lt;profile-path&gt;/chatzilla/scripts</tt> directory for files named
  <tt>init.js</tt>.  Any files found there are loaded at startup.  To install
  a script that someone else wrote, just copy it into a file called
  <tt>init.js</tt> in a new subdirectory of <tt>chatzilla/scripts</tt>.  To
  find out where <tt>&lt;profile-path&gt;</tt> is on your system, type
  <tt>/pref profilePath</tt>.
  <p/>
  ChatZilla will also load <tt>chatzilla/scripts/init.js</tt> at startup, if
  it exists.  It is recommended that you use this for one-off, personal 
  scripts, or for any script that might need to make sure it is the first one
  loaded.

<entry id="prefs">
<question>
  How do I tweak the rest of the preferences?
</question>

<answer>
  There are two ways.  The first, and easiest, is to use the prefs dialog.
  <ul>
    <li><menu>Edit<submenu/>ChatZilla Preferences</menu> (Mozilla Suite, all
      platforms)</li>
    <li><menu>Edit<submenu/>Preferences</menu> (Mozilla Firefox, Linux)</li>
    <li><menu>Tools<submenu/>Options</menu> (Mozilla Firefox, other
      platforms)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <note>Some settings, like the text transformation prefs, do not take
  effect until ChatZilla has been restarted.</note>
  
  If you want more control, want access to "hidden" prefs, use the
  <tt>/pref</tt> command, or one of the variants.  Type <tt>/pref</tt> to
  list all of the global preferences.
  <p/>
  You may provide a pref name, or just the first few letters of a pref name, to
  see the current value of matching preferences.  To change a preference, type
  <tt>/pref pref-name new-value</tt>.  To edit a preference for a specific
  network, channel, or user, use <tt>/network-pref</tt>, <tt>/channel-pref</tt>,
  or <tt>/user-pref</tt>.  There are network, channel, and user specific
  variants of the <tt>/motif</tt> command as well.

<question>
  How do the faces motifs work?
</question>

<answer>
  The
   <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/faces.pl">faces motifs</a>
  are nothing more than css files.  They work just like any other
  <a href="#make-motif">motif</a>, except they insert images before certain
  nicknames.  Those images are located on a web server, along with the CSS
  files.  If your CSS-fu is strong, you may want to take a look at the

  Is there an IRC channel for ChatZilla?
</question>

<answer>
  Of course there is!  The channel is
  <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla</a> on
  <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org">irc.mozilla.org</a>.
  <p/>
    If you are running
    Mozilla and already have
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/">ChatZilla</a>
    installed, you can join the channel by clicking on the <b>#chatzilla</b> link
    above.

    If you are new to IRC, please read over
    <a href="http://www.irchelp.org">irchelp.org</a>.
  <p/>
    Please be patient if you join <b>#chatzilla</b> looking to ask a question.
    I'm pretty much always logged
    on to IRC, but that doesn't mean I'm actually looking at the window, or
    even sitting in front of the computer.  If I see your question before you
    leave the channel, chances are I'll answer it.  If you include the word
    ``chatzilla'' in your question, it'll ring a bell on my machine which may
    make me respond sooner.  Please don't abuse that :)  Often times there will
    be other ChatZilla developers and/or users on #chatzilla who may be
    able to answer your question just as well.

  Where can I find more motifs?
</question>

<answer>
  The
  <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/motifs/">motifs directory on hacksrus.com</a>
  has a number of alternate motifs, in addition to the stock motifs.  You can 
  use these motifs by dragging the <code>.css</code> file onto ChatZilla's
  message window,
  or by using the <code>/motif</code> command.
  <p/>
  If you
  have <a href="#make-motif">made your own motif</a>, and would like me to
  serve it here, please say so.

<entry id="source">
<question>
  Where is the ChatZilla source code located?
</question>

<answer>
  ChatZilla is written
  entirely in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>XUL</b> and lives in 
  <tt>ChatZilla.jar</tt> in the Mozilla Chrome directory. You can view the 
  source on-line using LXR:
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc">mozilla/extensions/irc/</a>.
  Most of the actual front-end code is in the
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content">xul/content/</a>
  subdirectory, and you'll find the supporting libaries in
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/js/lib/">js/lib/</a>
  subdirectory.
  <p/>
  If you want to change things, you're much better off using a ChatZilla 
  plugin, then you don't need to keep re-applying your changes each time 
  there's a new version. See <a href="#scripts">How do I script ChatZilla?</a> 
  for more information on this.
